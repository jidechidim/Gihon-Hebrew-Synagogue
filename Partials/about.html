      <p class="lede">
        Gihon Hebrew Synagogue was founded in 1992; we are rooted in Torah observance as transmitted by
        Moshe Rabbeinu and oral Torah as expounded by Chazal; with an emphasis on preserving Jewish
        heritage while engaging with contemporary life. Our leaders are dedicated to offering spiritual guidance,
        education, and programs that meet the  diverse needs of our community. Gihon Hebrew Synagogue is
        more than just a place of worship; we are a vibrant and welcoming community where Jewish values,
        tradition, and spirituality come together. Our  synagogue is a home for individuals and families to grow in
        their faith, learn, and find support. Whether you are new to the faith, seeking a spiritual home, or looking
        to connect with others, you will find a place here with us.
